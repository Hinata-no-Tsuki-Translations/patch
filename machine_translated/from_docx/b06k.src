[Konomi] "Ningen-kun, have you finished fishing?"

When I approached and called out, Konomi came out of the water.

This area seems to be shallow water up to Konomi's waist.

There are no particularly dangerous fish, and it would be a great playground on a hot day.

Konomi, trembling like a furry animal and dripping with water, quickly moved away from me.

[Konomi] "Ningen-kun, it smells really bad‾"

Covering his nose and mouth with his hands, he was completely grimacing.

"Huh? Right? After eating, I also took a bath."

I tried smelling it myself, but I don't really understand it myself.

I just don't know because my nose is used to it, but I wonder if it smells so bad.

#voice konb0433
[Konomi] "The smell of smoke and the smell of blood. You caught a lot of fish. That's great."

Even though I say that, Konomi takes a distant attitude, so I feel like I'm being disliked.

"... don't look so displeased. Humans have to eat to live, so it can't be helped, right?"

#voice konb0434
[Konomi] "I know it can't be helped‾?

“Even so, it really makes me feel bad when people say it smells weird that many times.”

[Konomi] "I'm sorry‾? I thought I had gotten used to being with Ningen-kun‾"

"Well, it's fine, but..."

For the time being, I squat down for comfort and try washing my hands again in the spring.

… However, I don’t think the smell will go away with something like this.

Konomi seemed to have come up with something, and suddenly approached me――

Whoa!

With a big splash, I was helplessly pushed into the spring with my clothes on.

"Hey, Conomy..."

[Konomi] "Yeah. If it's in the water, it doesn't smell weird."

"That's good... not! Because you'll die!? If you suddenly push a human into the spring, you'll be surprised and drown and die!?"

Also, it's a scary place to hit your head if you get pushed into such a shallow place.

Luckily, I only had to hit the surface of the water with my body.

[Konomi] "Ningen-kun, are you drowning?"

“I wasn’t drowning.

This area is deep enough to touch your feet, so it's fine, but if you get pushed down like that, any great swimmer could drown.

People can drown in puddles.

[Konomi] "Huh? I didn't mean to surprise Ningen-kun, did I? I'm sorry‾"

"Also, humans don't swim with their clothes on."

#voice konb0441
[Konomi] "But, when humans swim, they wear clothes, right?"

"That's a swimsuit! If you leave it on, it will absorb water and it's dangerous if it clings to your body, so I only wear the bare minimum."

I mean, even though swimsuits are customs for people who live in the city, are aristocrats, and are rich, they know something strange.

[Konomi] "I see, so I made a mistake. But my clothes also had a bad smell, so why don't we wash them together?"

Konomi waved her hand with no regrets.

... Somehow, I can't even get angry.

With my clothes on, I jumped into the spring from head to toe, shook my hands and feet, and scrubbed my head and clothes.

The smell that I don't really understand, is this really going down ...?

"Ha ha ha ha ha"

Somehow, the tea becomes cloudy, I get up from the water, and squeeze the hem of my clothes.

The water dripped with a frightening force.

"Uheh, it's disgusting that it sticks to your skin. You shouldn't be swimming while wearing it."

#voice konb0443
[Konomi] "Then, take off your clothes and go for a swim‾ You should have washed and dried your clothes separately‾"

"If Konomi didn't push me down, I could have done that."

"It's enough, I'm not angry. But if you come up with something from now on, tell me first. I'm begging you."

#voice konb0445
[Konomi] "I see. If you feel like it, be careful."

Konomi crossed the shallows and came to my side, whistling and circling around me.

"So, what do you think?"

"No, I guess my body got cold because I was hit by the wind while still wet."

I didn't have a runny nose, but I slurped my nose.

"Whose fault, whose fault?"

[Konomi] "But hey, it smells bad, don't you hate it?"

"Still say, this!"

When I reached out to catch Konomi, Konomi turned around and avoided it.

Because of that, the foot that stepped on the tatara makes a big splash.

Even though I was able to dodge even the splash of water brilliantly, Konomi protested against me.

"Who do you think caused me to get soaked?"

[Konomi] "Huh? No, it's disgusting to stick to your clothes when you get wet, isn't it?"

"I already feel sick!"

I tried to chase Konomi, but the resistance in the water is strong and I can't run as I want.

Still, as expected of an elf. Konomi is very light and easy to move around freely even in the water.

"Wait this!"

Like that, Konomi and I chased each other in the water until the sun went down.
