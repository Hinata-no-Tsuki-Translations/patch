It was fine to go to the spring to play, but the weather suddenly became suspicious and I had to return home in a hurry.

Even the fish that had gone to great lengths to dry would be ruined if it hit the rain, so I hurriedly withdrew it from the spring.

As I was unloading my belongings after entering the hut, I started to hear the sound of rain.

Ibara grabbed my hand and let it go immediately, but Hinata thought she couldn't get up, and tried to pull me up.
