Seeing an orc so close to me made me barely hold back the urge to scream.

The orcs I saw for the first time looked extremely ugly.

"...!?"

Just when I was nervous, I heard a voice from behind me and almost jumped.

#voice hinb0581
[Hinata] "Ningen-san, was there an orc?"

“Bah… If you make too much noise, you’ll be found, right?”

I quickly covered Hinata's mouth and hid behind something.

Then, when I quietly tried to check on the oak...

#voice hinb0583
[Hinata] "Oh...!? Mogo!"

“So please be quiet.”


[Orc 1] "Hmm? Did you say something?"


[Oak 2] “No, nothing.”


[Oak 3] “Isn’t it an insect or a bird?”

An orc passes so close that I can almost touch it if I reach out.

I desperately held Hinata's mouth and held my breath as I waited until they were out of sight.

Fortunately, the orc didn't seem to notice us and disappeared deep into the dark forest.

"Hmm...did you go?"

As I was breathing a deep sigh of relief, Hinata suddenly started acting up.

"Ah, ah, that's bad. It's okay now."

He happened to pass by yesterday, but that doesn't mean he'll pass by next time.

Therefore, I decided to cast a spell on the hut to ward off orcs.

"Ah... ah, that's right."

At this moment, I felt like I was touching Hinata's real face, and I couldn't help but feel a strange emotion.
