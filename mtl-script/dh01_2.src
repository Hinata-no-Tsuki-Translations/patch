"I've been eating normally until now and I'm fine, so I guess everyone was just surprised today."

I patted Hinata's head, uttering a solace that I couldn't even begin to describe.

I've often been told that the food smells bad, but I was once again reminded of the difference in perception between elves and humans.

Hinata, who had broken that balance, was being avoided so blatantly.

I enjoyed eating sweets, and I wasn't as negative about eating meat and fish as I am today, so I didn't think about it too seriously...

Since I'm a human, I was just allowed to eat because I had no choice, so I guess I was against eating the food after all.

I let out a sigh.

"At least, I was happy that Hinata said it was delicious."

Hinata smiles and seems as if the interaction with Tsukiyo before leaving had never happened.

I'll be saying goodbye to this smile soon...

"While Hinata was out, someone came to pick you up. Didn't you meet her when you were coming back?"

[Hinata] "Pyo!? Head over heels!? What's going on?! Hinata, I haven't even looked at you!"

"He's an elf called Ibara no Onii-san. Doesn't Hinata know about it?"

When I asked, Hinata shook her head.

"You do not know"

[Hinata] "I don't know! I know! Izumi's elf, right!"

Do you know? Even though they know, they shake their heads or give confusing reactions.

"Is that the emblem of the fountain on him?"

That's probably what was on his forehead. Now that I think about it, I have no idea that the thing on my forehead is a fountain.

[Hinata] "Sodayo!? How do you know Human-san!? Did you show it to me!?"

"I was shown it because there was a forehead in a certain place. I just thought it made sense because Hinata said it was a spring elf."

[Hinata] "Oh!? I see. It's so cool that you can understand everything just from Human-san!"

Hinata jumps up and down, wondering what makes her happy.

"Then, he said something like, ``The road is getting narrower, so we should get back quickly.''

[Hinata] "Hohoo! Is the path getting narrower!?"

"No, it's about elves, so I don't know much about them. I wonder if those fountain elves will come looking for Hinata again!?"

[Hinata] "It's a big deal! It's hide and seek!"

"Why are you playing hide-and-seek with the one who came to pick you up because you were so worried? It's the other way around, right? It makes me a little lonely though..."

Continuing from the tsukkomi I had made without thinking, I was about to say goodbye when Hinata stopped and looked up at me.

[Hinata] "...Goodbye? Mr. Human, should Hinata go back to the elf?"

It's troubling when people look me in the eye and ask me questions like that.

Well, I also feel like I want to be with everyone a little more...especially Hinata.

After all, I never get tired of watching Hinata's expression change as she spins around, and I want to keep her by my side forever.

"I can't say it's better to go back. I want to be with Hinata too."

[Hinata] "So..."

Hinata loosened her clenched fist and let out a sigh of relief.

“But I don’t think the spring elf will come to pick me up again.”

If you're looking for an elf who has left the barrier, it wouldn't be strange for them to come looking for you again before the barrier is completely closed.

At that time, if I say I won't return, won't that mean I won't be able to return to the elf village?

[Hinata] "No, I think it's okay."

I wonder why I thought Hinata looked sad when she was smiling.

[Hinata] "Izumi's elf won't come looking for you if Hinata is the only one missing."

“Is there something else you need to do since you told me to hurry?”

I didn't say that I would come again if you asked me that. If you said you sent a message, I guess that means you should come back by yourself.

[Hinata] "Yes, I'm sure so. Izumi's elf must be busy! I'm sure she won't have time to come looking for Hinata."

Hinata was smiling happily as usual, but for some reason something resembling a thorn scratched inside my chest.

"...Hinata"

[Hinata] “What is it, Human-san?”

“No, it’s nothing.”

I didn't know what to say, so I patted Hinata on the head.

[Hinata] "Wow!? If you crumple up, you'll get stuck in the head!"

...Are you thinking too much?
