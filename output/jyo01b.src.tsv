7	Even if the ivy seems to have no killing ability at first glance, that thing is a monster, and that itself is scary.
9	After all, there are rumors that it hangs and kills its prey.
11	From what I see, it seems to be quite durable because it can lift people, but it seems that the attacking range is not too far.
13	Also, since it suddenly attacked me, I felt like it was moving fast, but in reality it doesn't seem to move that fast.
15	If so, isn't it a wise choice to escape now?
17	I'm sorry for the captured child, but my life is also precious.
19	It's enough to simply imagine a dramatic development where you die trying to save someone.
21	As I turned my back to escape, I heard a voice from the captured child.
24	【？？？】「Onii-san, help me pleasee. My stomach is already hurting……aha、ahahahahaha、stop tickling meeeー！」
26	「……it seems it is okay to leave it alone」
28	Even though she's caught, she doesn't feel a sense of crisis.
31	【？？？】「I said help me, ah, blood is dripping from my headー……」
33	Aaa, fine! I'm not so frightened that I feel like running away！
35	Well, I feel pity for her hanging upside down.
37	I stopped trying to escape for the time being and turned towards the ivy monster.
39	If I try for a while and find it impossible, I can run away again.
41	「Anyway, see if a knife can cut it」
43	If this doesn't work, sorry to the captured child, but I will give up.
45	It seems to move slowly, and it's probably safe to run away from it later.
47	I took out a small knife and tried to cut the ivy monster.
