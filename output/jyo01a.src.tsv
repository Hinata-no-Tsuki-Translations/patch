8	As a person, I cannot ignore others in need.
10	To leave another behind in danger and watch them die, I'll definitely get nightmares from that.
12	I've been asked to help.
14	「……But, I've never fought a monster」
16	No, I've never fought even if it wasn't a monster.
18	If anything, since I was a kid, I've avoided even conflicts between humans if they can be avoided.
20	It was more comfortable to read a book alone than to quarrel.
22	But now I can't say that.
24	I have to help the child who is caught somehow.
26	If this is a normal creature, there is something that seems to be a weak point, but it is not clear where the ivy monster is the head and the belly.
28	I've read a lot of books, but none of them have a way to defeat such a monster!?
30	「If cut into pieces, it won't multiply right……」
32	As I approached and pierced the edge cautiously, the ivy danced in a squiggly manner.
34	Is it something that can be cut in the first place?
36	Isn't the fact that it can hang a person proof that it is fairly durable?
38	Perhaps it is reckless to challenge the ivy to battle itself.
40	When I was at a loss, the captured child stared at me with moist eyes.
48	【？？？】「Onii-saan、If you don't save me soon……fuhya……my sides will hurt……fuhyahyahyahya」
50	「……Aren't you laughing too much?」
53	【？？？】「But, it's ticklish……」
55	Even though I'm being asked for help, and my opponent is a monster, the presence of this child makes me lose my temper.
57	However, thanks to that, a strange tension fled my body.
60	「Anyway, see if a knife can cut it」
62	I became calm, took out the small knife from my pocket and started to cut the ivy.
