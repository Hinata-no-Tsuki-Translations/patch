35	【？？？】「Onii-san!　Heelp〜！」
37	A scene beyond imagination made me speechless。
52	Hanging down in midair was a cute girl, with limbs as delicate as young branches that they can easily break.
54	White skin like alabaster, golden hair like honey that gathered/collected the sunlight, and blue eyes like a clear sky, which I rarely see around here.
56	While such a beautiful girl writhes in the ivy she is entwined with, she reaches her hand towards me.
58	Almost as if, it was a work of art……。
61	【？？？】「Dooon't juuust looook〜！　Leeeet meeee dooown〜！！」
63	…but, regrettably the subject's facial expression and the motif are dissociated as a component of art.
65	In these scenes, the subject's expression should be twisted in agony, or otherwise in esctacy, either one it should be.
67	It's not like I have any artistic background, but I idly thought about it.
69	While she is asking for help, there is a lack of urgency in her cheerful expression……。
74	『Nyoron』
76	While escaping reality, in the corner of my vision,  I caught sight of part of the vine that caught the girl slithering like a mollusk.
78	Before long, it resembled a prey-searching snake evaluating its captured prisoner. 
80	It had no eyes it could possibly see through, but it seems to have a sensory organ similar to that？
82	I can understand logically I'm being targeted to, but it doesn't connect to my emotions and I don't feel a sense of crisis.
84	Ivy……is a plant, right. If only flowers could bloom from it.
86	――That's right, if flowers bloomed, the depiction of this trapped girl would also have been much more deeply coloured.
88	I'm sure that scene would definitely have looked sensual.
90	But of course even just with ivy, a situation with a girl tied up is sensual enough already.
93	【？？？】「Oniisaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan！」
95	The girl's scream echoes in the sky.
97	Aa, this is a joke right? Or maybe I'm in a dream.
99	When I left house this morning, I did not ever think that I'll get into this situation.
101	No, I couldn't think this is a possibility.
103	This goes way beyond the scope of my imagination.
105	……because, this is impossible.
118	「……that's about all」
126	I looked at the small luggage I had put together and muttered. For now, it's good enough to bring what I need immediately.
128	This house will be left as is, so if I need anything more, I can come again to take them.
130	Even then, the things I think are important to my life now may eventually become unnecessary.
132	「……next-」
137	The silver coins I received from the village head makes a defining tinny (jyagari) noise in my hands.
139	「With this much, I can get by for the time being.」
141	I took out a few coins out of the pouch. Even with all these coins in my hand, it was light enough to make me uneasy.
143	With only those livestock, I could only exchange for these much……。
145	Even though the village head said he was concerned for me, but when it came to buying my livestock, he bought them off at a mercilessly low price.
147	The result of that was these few silver coins. He really took advantage of my circumstances.
149	After my mum died, since I still took care of my lifestock, it should have been more well-maintained and fed than any other livestock in the village.
151	He said, his finances was also in dire straits.
153	He said, it's not just about raising the livestock.
155	It's not that I don't understand what the village head said.
157	Because for the people who live in this remote village, every one of them are doing their best in their daily lives.
159	……it's not that I don't know that.
161	Since I decided to leave the village, I can't take care of them anymore. Even if I've decided to leave, at least sell my livestock for their sake.
163	Rather than go wild or starve at my place, it should be much better for new owners to take care of them.
165	Releasing them in the fields……the strong will survive on their own, but the weak will be driven out like weeds.
167	Aside from the animals who came after mother died, I did not invest any time in maintaining the fields. By now, they are quite desolate.
169	Though such a narrow field, mother was always taking care of it alone.
171	Humans are the same as crops in the fields. We help one another as we live together in the village, but we cannot afford to care for those who may not be useful to the village.
173	Unneeded things are cut off and thinned, fats are reused as fertilizer. If not, the fields cannot be maintained.
175	The me who says I'm released from my shackles and decided to live in the forest, I wonder if I was a crop or a weed.
177	When mother was alive, we managed to maintain decency as a member of the village, but after mother died, my motivation was lost.
179	Like my mother, raise a few livestock, maintain the fields……then so what.
181	I cannot bear to live in this village.
183	Isn't that so. How can I get along with those who shun me as an outsider just because I can read a few words?
185	How should I get along with those who do not know the value of writing or academia?
187	Until now I was an outsider. Instead of living suffocatingly in the village, living alone in the forest should suit be better.
189	And this benefits the other villagers as well.
191	「Well then……it's about time to go」
193	While thinking that it could be the last, I turn around to take sight at the intimately familiar house once more.
195	Will I ever come back to this house, I wonder.
200	……I'm going to take only belongings that I'll need for the time being. Although the fact that I was to depart from here soon does not change, my determination to leave made me feel sentimental.
212	「Maybe I should have reduced my luggage a little more」
214	After a while of traversing the mountains, I whined to myself.
216	As it was not certain that I would find a base immediately, I regretted not deciding where I would stay before carrying my luggage.
218	I did thought to use a mountain hut built a long time ago, but no one in the village knows if the hut still exists.
220	That's also because the mountain hut is said to be near a dark forest where monsters appear, so no villager gets close to it.
222	My grandfather said when he was middle-aged there was a person living there, so I think the hut might still remain there.
224	In the first place, there are few villagers who can read and write, so no proper records were left.
226	It is also suspicious if the village council does any work at all.
228	To the extent it makes me question if they made the job position just to drink and socialize together.
230	……What should I do if it is completely weathered away. If I don't have the hut I was counting on, I might no choice but to return to the village.
232	As I thought, maybe I should have aimed for the town, not the mountain hut?
234	But there are many people in town, and I have no idea how to get clothes, food and shelter in town.
236	「……Aaー、heavy」
238	The luggage I intended to be small, was too heavy to swing around freely.
240	「But, it's mostly an animal trail」
242	Whlie wiping dripping sweat with the back of my hand, I gazed at the pathless road and muttered.
244	The roadway is under renovation and few people walk the the path near the mountain, so even by walking it's inconvenient.
246	I can see why no one has lived in this forest for a while.
248	The overgrown thick trees in the forest seem to look down menacingly, almost as if to threaten any intruders.
250	Come to think of it, there have been strange rumors of this forest for a long time.
252	It is said that monsters appear in this forest.
254	It may be a legend to frighten children from entering the forest, I was often told that monsters would appear when I was a kid.
256	That there are non-anthropomorphic beings like trolls and orcs roaming in the forest, that their favourite food was human children.
258	And it seems that the country itself has declared not to enter too deep because monsters will come out.
260	That's why even adults form groups and do not venture too deep into the forest.
262	On that note, there may be resources in the forest, but no one would risk themselves for a place where it is uncertain whether there may be resources or not.
264	The villagers are not that wealthy, but able to make a rich enough living in that remote village.
266	……but is it really true monsters will appear?
268	Plus there is a neighbouring country beyond the forest, so it may be a story to avoid pointless conflicts.
270	In the olden days, this country had fierce conflicts with neighboring countries, so it is quite possible that monsters meant the enemies.
272	「……though in that case, it would be interesting if elves appeared」
274	I having seen them, but elves seem to be a very beautiful race. What's more, they are said to bring wealth and glory or something.
276	In the royal capital, there are many rich people who keep such elves as pets. I have been told such a story by a traveler who occasionally visited the village.
278	Are they said to bring wealth and glory because rich people keep them as pets? Or is really keeping them as pets made them wealthy?
280	It's a pity that we can never confirm the truth of the story as those who have only been to the town at best.
282	Anyway, it's a drunken story at the sake table, but if it sells really high, I definitely want to catch one. Then, it would be good to go to the royal capital and start a business.
284	More than that, there is also a simple curiosity that I want to meet and see. What kind of creature is an elf that is so beautiful that it captivates?
286	I've heard that elves live in this forest, but most of them are the morals of human beings who got carried away and faced a terrible punishment.
288	Like the story of monsters in the forest, it's meant to tell a child something, and it's just as suspicious if it can be believed or not.
290	If elves really appearaed, even if I can't catch it, I catch a glance and worship it.
292	……however. The dense forest reminds me of strange monsters more strongly than the fun delusions of beautiful elves and fairies.鬱蒼とした森は、綺麗なエルフや妖精と言った愉快な妄想よりも、得体のしれない魔物たちをより強く想起させる。
294	For example, a human-eating demon lurking in the shadow of a tree, under the grass, and so on……
296	「……stupid」
298	At least I've never heard of such a story along the roadway.
300	Here is not far from that roadway, and not far from the village, there's no reason for monsters appearing in this place.
302	There are many rumors about the forest, but most of them should be myths to warn children. I decided.
304	When I was a kid, I sometimes laughed holding my stomach at the horror story that was told as if it were true.
306	I think there wasn't a single credible story about the appearance of monsters from the day I was born.
308	Someone's grandfather……I've heard, but it's a story conjured by adults who tease children and lie…….
310	At best, there's hearsay from travelers that monsters had appeared.
312	If so, are the rabbits and birds that hunters often hunt safe from monsters?
314	At best, it's a weasel or a fox.
316	Un. That's right. That's decided.
318	It's unreasonable to be scared of such things.
320	No, a wolf or a bear may come out once in a while……even if it does……if I come across it I'll be dead. Will be good if I don't meet any.
325	『Gyaaaaaaaaaaa！』
327	「Mm！？」
329	I jumped suddenly from the cry I heard nearby.
331	When I looked there in a hurry, the birds flew away with a loud noise.
333	「Oh it's a bird. Afraid if it was an orc」
335	Saying these words to no one but myself to get rid of unpleasant thoughts.
337	A monster that attaches to humans, slurps its vitality, and turns them into souless humans.
339	The fairy tale I heard when I was a kid could not leave my mind.
341	In reality, the beasts are much scarier than those, and it's those that I should be weary of. But my mind swims with imaginations of non-anthropomorphic monsters.
343	……no no. That kind of thing, can't possibly exist.
345	But, if they did, what should I do.
348	【？？？】「……Honyaa……Funiyuuu……Hel……」
350	「！？」
352	I pressed my lips shut to stifle a scream. That was definitely a human voice just now.
354	When I was scared for an unknown reason, I heard someone making noise, so I listened anxiously.
357	【？？？】「……Nyuuuuuuuu……Iyaaaan……Pukyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu……」
359	……What's that？　Could be a scream, could be a prank.
361	As soon as I recognized it as a human voice, my calmness returned.
363	「……There's still people here huh」
365	I thought I had finally reached deep into the forest, but I felt relieved and disappointed.
368	【？？？】「……Nyaaaaaaaaaaaaa……Help……」
370	「Is it calling for help？」
372	I felt like I could clearly hear the words calling for help, and for a moment I thought to run away, but for the time being, I went closer to check it out.
382	「What is this……」
384	Then, going in a bit deeper into the forest, the sight of a girl hanging in mid-air, entwined in ivy greeted my eyes.
386	It doesn't look like anyone from these parts, and I don't recognize her at all. Such a beautiful child, I should be able to remember it at first glance.
388	Perhaps she was traveling, separated from her companions and became lost in the forest.
390	But, that's some light clothing……。
392	No, aside from the child's origin, I couldn't immediately think of what to do in a scene that was far from the common sense I had lived in.
394	Because it's not an man-made trap that caught the girl, it's ivy.
397	【？？？】「Nnnkyuuuuuuuu……help……onii-san！」
399	「Do you really want my help？」
401	The question leaked from my mouth because she lacked a sense of urgency.
403	If she's just fooling around, it's boring to reach out and go along with it.
405	It is also possible that children are just playing with one another.
407	I was surprised when I first saw it, but it's possible to tie her with ivy growing around there. Children can do this kind of mischief.
410	【？？？】「Etto etto, please help me. Let me downー」
412	「You were playing and got trapped？」
414	The child shook her head after I was tired of hearing her call for help and inquired the situation.
422	【？？？】「I got caughtー」
424	「……Caught？」
426	The ivy moved in front of my eyes as I wondered if it was tag or something.
428	Eh？　Why is it moving？
430	No, ivy grows so it moves in that sense, but this ivy moves with physically ...I-is this ivy a monster!?
439	【？？？】「Onii-san！　Heeelpp〜！」
441	The child entwined with the ivy cried out and wriggled her body, but there was not a single sign that she could be released at all.
443	As if asking for help, her hands reached towards me.
446	【？？？】「Stop waatching〜！　LetーMeーDoWNー〜！！」
450	『Nyoron』
452	The ivy, which behaved as slimy as a mollusk, seemed to set me as a new target.
460	【？？？】「ONIIII-SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN！」
462	By the way, the child who is asking for help is pretty beautiful…… I escaped from reality for a moment, and then jumped away from the attacking ivy.
467	It seems that only the linear movement towards me was very fast.
469	I'm so confused that I don't really understand the situation I'm in.
471	「Uu、Uwaa！　Monster！」
473	After being attacked by the monster of the ivy, my thoughts and emotions were finally connected in a straight line.
475	Oh right, it was said that there are monsters in this forest who hang themselves and kill their entwined prey.
477	At least it seems that story wasn't a lie.
479	Indeed, this ivy seems to be able to hang and kill its prey.
481	……Strangle to death？
483	As I calmly recalled the story I had heard in the past, I realized that this monster was in front of me. I was so shocked that I hurriedly ran off.
485	……Strangled to death？
487	Being targeted means that I'm also considered a prey!?
489	Oh no. Bad. Oh no.
491	Could this be a life-threatening danger?
493	There seems to be a limit to the distance that the ivy can grow, and when I step back, the ivy squirms and twists, but eventually it goes down.
495	Can't move that far?
497	I was relieved that the ivy had given up on catching me, but one child was still caught in front of me.
499	……I forgot。
502	【？？？】「Aaan, I said help me. Uhyahyahya, it tickles……Uhyahyahyahyahya」
504	The hanging child is laughing without any sense of crisis.
506	No, she is tickled to the point of laughter?
508	The movement of the ivy monster doesn't seem to be that fast unless it moves straight, and if you run away quickly it will be difficult to for it to chase.
510	But what should I do if I get caught.
517	ともかく俺はどうするべきなんだろう。
529	Ａ：Help
530	Ｂ：Do not help
