42	The wind blew.
48	【？？？】「Wow wow, here is the world of humans」
50	A timid rabbit was shocked and its ears perked up to listen.
52	Small animals jumped into the burrow in flock.
54	The first to notice, was weak animals with no way to protect themselves.
56	The animals went into their burrow in this manner with no choice but to wait trembling until the irregular occurence passes through.
60	【Troll】「GuururururuuoOOO……？」
62	The next to realise, were those with no intellect.
64	Since that is in a sense, weakness.
66	A slight feeling of amiss informed only those with sharp senses.
68	In the instant the world tried to change, there might have been a sound of something breaking.
70	――In other words, vibration as soundless as a veil coming undone.
72	Two worlds in different dimensions overlap, melt, and intersect.
74	The worlds separated by boundaries since a long time ago, was trying to become one again――。
132	【？？？】「……」
137	【Fountain Elf】『Have you awaken, Thorn Elf』
142	【？？？】「Yes, ani-ue.……just now, the barrier--」
169	【？？？】「Uwaa〜、this is the first time I've seen such a huge spring〜」
171	The elf who stepped into the unknown world let out an exclaimation of admiration.
183	The presence of the irregularity that the small beings noticed, was also known as is by the elves who lived there.
185	For an elf having lived many years, this happening was not the first, but had forgotten after a long while.
187	Some felt anxious as something new was born
188	Some felt delight in seeing this world for the first time.
190	A life that knew no fear jumped out of the world of limits, and boldly set foot in the unfamiliar land.
199	【？？？】「……」
201	The expectations from the world seen for the first time was to satisfaction of curiosity and new stimuli.
203	That was no exception to this cowardly dark elf, whom the elves regarded as should be detested.
223	【？？？】「Wow wow, this is the world of humans」
225	The nameless elf celebrated in joy, spread his little arms as if clasping the sky of the human world.
230	【？？？】「Waa~！　Will I meet humans？　I really want to meet humans quickly--」
232	The world is wide.
234	But, I am little.
236	Small little one, be happy.
238	Just, be happy.
